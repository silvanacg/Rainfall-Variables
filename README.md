# Rainfall-Variables

**RainfallVar_Calculation** : Script to compute rainfall variables associated to PFDFs like storm duration, average intensity, cummulative rainfall, peak 15, 30, 60min intensities and antecedent rainfall. 

**Rainfall_clusters:** Computes clusters of antecedent rainfall for PFDF events based on methods described on Bevacqua et al. (2021) for a time window of 90 days using Daymet daily precipitation dataset (Thornton et al., 2014).
